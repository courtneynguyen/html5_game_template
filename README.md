html5_game_template
===================

html5_game_template is designed with the idea of a reusable game template for canvas games. In this template I include a number of basic functionality. If there are sections of functions that are not needed, delete the section, because although my template is verbose, it covers several basic usages. 

### Prerequisites ###
- Experience with JavaScript (to edit and delete sections of code).
- Dependencies (install using bower -install

### Dependencies ###
1. EaselJS
2. SoundJS
3. PreloadJS
4. TweenJS

### Functionality ###

1. SpriteSheets
2. Preloading resources 
3. Different screens
4. Buttons
5. Key listeners
6. Sound
7. Tweening
 

### Why use $this template?
This template exercises basic coding principals that help make code strong. I use enclosures, and my code is documented by sections. My template is easy to use, and read. Plus, I am quick to get back on the mailing list.
